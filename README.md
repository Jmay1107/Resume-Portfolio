This is a simple responsive website portfolio to use for job applications, freelance work, or just to get a better understanding of how HTML and CSS work.
Notes have been left on the code itself to help any confusion on design elements I personal like or where photos are to go; they are also used to outline each section in both the CSS and HTML files for easy modifications and maintain user friendliness.

                                                               ==Directions==
1.Once you have the code on your own repositery/ coding software, change what you see fit be it **icons, info, pictures, color scheme, etc**.
2.When changing photos, create a file with photos you want to used in it on your desktop and change the "src" to the *name of that folder/photo name*
